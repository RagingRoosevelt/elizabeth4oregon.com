<h1>About Elizabeth Graser-Lindsey</h1>

<p><img src="/images/elizabeth.jpg" align="right" width="25%" style="border-radius: 25%; padding: 1ch;"></img> A small farmer and former university professor, Elizabeth has spent much of her volunteer time during the past two decades since moving to Beavercreek on local land-use and transportation issues. She got involved with local politics in the mid 1990s, when Metro selected Beavercreek for urbanization by designating it as an urban reserve.

<p>Elizabeth helped re-activate the Beavercreek Community Planning Organization and was the co-chief petitioner for Beavercreek to be one of only four neighborhoods to be recognized by the county as a hamlet. She has since opposed Oregon City's plans to develop along Beavercreek Road without raising traffic standards, which she sees as responsible for allowing traffic to clog and ruining livability.

<p>Elizabeth previously served on Clackamas County's Transportation System Plan committee for two years. During her one year on the county's Traffic Safety Commission, she advocated for rural road safety by pointing out ditches along roads, the lack of turnouts and blind hills with fatal crashes.

<p> After majoring in soil science, she got her Ph.D. in bio-environmental engineering and did agricultural research for the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1985-88 in Florida. She a professor of agricultural meteorology and climatology at the University of Hawaii for about eight years in the late 1980s and early '90s.

<p> Elizabeth has lived 22 years in Beavercreek, where she and her husband raised and homeschooled their three children, now young adults. She has been an active parent in 4-H, the local high school equestrian team, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, in educational programs, and in her church. She raises San Clemente Island goats and is helping one of her children get started in farming.
