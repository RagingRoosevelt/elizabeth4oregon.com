## She led the fight that kept Metro out of Beavercreek
 
After an agricultural research career, Elizabeth and her husband raised their three kids on their Beavercreek farm.

Twenty years ago Metro targeted Beavercreek for urbanization despite overwhelming community opposition.  Elizabeth joined the regional lawsuit opposing Metro and rallied supporters.  That victory kept Metro out of Beavercreek and preserved its rural character.


## Elizabeth will work tirelessly for us

"Over 20 years I’ve witnessed Elizabeth advocate for preserving our rural community values and lead efforts to strengthen our resiliency. She’s been there when neighbors need a hand, and, as our representative, she’ll work tirelessly for all of us." -- Linda Gerber, Gerber-Christensen Family Farm, PCC-Sylvania President (retired)
