# Elizabeth Is A Proven Leader Who Gets Results

<img src="/images/elizabeth_hi.jpg" align="right" class="inline" style="border-radius: 25%; padding: 1ch;" alt="Elizabeth and Barry in Hawaii" />

## She led the fight that kept Metro out of Beavercreek

She and her husband of 30 years raised their three kids on their farm in Beavercreek.  When, over 20 years ago, Metro targeted Beavercreek for urbanization, she got to work.  She joined the regional lawsuit to oppose metro and she rallied supporters.  The courts overturned Metro's decision and her involvement kept Metro out of Beavercreek and preserved its small farms and rural character.  Then she continued that involvement.  Now Elizabeth wants to work for our district.
