<h1>About Elizabeth Graser-Lindsey</h1>

<p><img src="/images/elizabeth.jpg" align="right" width="25%" style="border-radius: 25%; padding: 1ch;" alt="Elizabeth petting a goat" /> The issue that drew me into public service is Metro’s decision to urbanize the rural community of Beavercreek despite overwhelming community opposition.  We activated our Community Planning Organization and I joined the merged lawsuits against Metro’s decision.   I learned how to do legal work and I rallied supporters.  Through this participation the courts decided to overturn Metro’s entire decision.  Over 20 years I have been protecting the interests of my community – protecting its rural nature, supporting local family-wage jobs, opposing road congestion and rural hazards.  I am ready to work for HD39.
