## Taming growth and maintaining our livability
* Solving traffic congestion and lack of safety
* Preserving farmlands from development
* Restoring Voter-Approved Annexations to Canby and Estacada
* Having growth pay its own way through System Development Charges rather than tolls, taxes, and bonds

## Re-invigorating the middle class

* Solving the shortage of local family-wage jobs by protecting jobs lands and incubating local business start ups
* Making a decent living at farming/ranching/logging
* Considering how exploding property costs price out Oregonian
* Raising low high-school graduation rates by solving the school funding impasse and by engaging students e.g by shop and band and mentors
* Addressing high decudtables that make health care inaccessable to many


## Protecting us and our environment

* Localize recycling (e.g. steel and paper mills and jobs) that previously was shipped to China
* Protecting farming from drought and us and our health from expensive and smoky wildfires
* Protecting our water supply from the declining snow pack on Mt. Hood which reduces rivers, causes fish kills and algae blooms (Clackamas River, 2015)
