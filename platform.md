<h1>What does Elizabeth stand for?</h1>

<p> Graser-Lindsey is concerned about how climate change is affecting our region. She has seen a reduction in snowpack feeding our drinking-water supply, fewer natural pastures for livestock and more dying perennials as the summers get drier.

<p>Graser-Lindsey also would like to look into solutions to gentrification. "Our kids, including my own, are priced out of the housing market in our district," she said. "Housing in the whole region has become largely unaffordable to most people."
